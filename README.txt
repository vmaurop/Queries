Using Linq  to Access a Collection of data of random numbers
#Expressions.cs  -  All functions implement via LINQ (Language Integrated Query) with the Method Syntax or Query Syntax

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have random numbers into a list of integers
The user sets the plural of how many numbers
Also the minimum and the maximum value of the sequence.
So, we have some functions where calculate min, max, average, even numbers of the sequence, order by ascending/descending etc


Example:

insert the count numbers:6
insert the min value:1
insert the max value:4

the sequence of random numbers are: 1,2,3,4,1,1  (it could be anything between [1-4], but should be 6 numbers as we set)

(6 numbers between [1-4] in a random way)

after that, we have a Menu which asks us what we want to do.
 
----exit, new data 1.Average 2.Max 3. Min ......etc -------

assume that we enter: 2
(Option:2)
means that we want to calculate the maximum of the sequence

Or next, we enter
Option: new data
means we start from the beginning with new list 

finally, if we choose Option: exit
--the program will be over--
